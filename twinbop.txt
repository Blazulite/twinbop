Let me tell you about the most beautiful skin in teeworlds - twinbop. Sure, everyone's running around with their basic default skins or trying to flex with some fancy community creation, but have you SEEN twinbop?
Those gradient eyes are absolutely mesmerizing. Like, you're trying to focus on hitting that tricky part and then BAM - your teammate shows up in twinbop and you're just staring at those dreamy color-shifting eyes instead of watching where you're hooking. It's honestly distracting how pretty this skin is.
And the colors! The way twinbop's gradient flows across the body - it's like someone took a sunset and wrapped it around a tee. No wonder half the server stops what they're doing when someone joins with twinbop equipped. We're all just standing there like "damn, that's one good-looking tee."
